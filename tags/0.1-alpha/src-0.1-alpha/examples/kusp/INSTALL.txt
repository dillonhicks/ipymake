INSTALLING KUSP FROM SOURCE
============================================


These instructions assume:
***************************

1) You are in the same directory as this file (INSTALL.txt)
2) You have set the following environmental variables in your bashrc
   by adding the lines:

   export KUSPROOT=<path-to-kusp-source>
   export KUSPINSTALL=<path-to-desired-install-directory>
   export KUSPKERNELROOT=<path-to-kusp-kernel-source>


STEPS
*******

1) Create a "build" directory to work in:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build

2) Run cmake <path to source>

$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KUSPINSTALL -DKERNELROOT=$KUSPKERNELROOT
$ make
$ make install

3) Now Set the following environmental variables in your bashrc:
   
   export PATH=$PATH:$KUSPINSTALL/bin
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$KUSPINSTALL/lib
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$KUSPINSTALL/lib/python<your-version-number>/site-packages

4) Reload your bashrc:

$ . ~/.bashrc

Alternate Source Install 
----------------------------------

You can replace steps (1) and (2) with:

$ make -f kusp.mk 

If you have the KUSPINSTALL and KERNELROOT environmental variables
defined. You will still need to complete steps (3) and (4).



INSTALLING FROM RPM
===============================

These instructions assume:
***************************

1) This is on machine running Fedora 10+.

Steps
************

1) Create a ~/tmp directory.

$ mkdir ~/tmp

2) Check out a copy of the KUSP trunk with the name 'kusp' into that directory:

$ cd ~/tmp
$ svn co https://subversion.ittc.ku.edu/svn/libertos/kusp/trunk  kusp

3) `cd' into the kusp directory and create the RPM

$ cd kusp
$ make -f kusp.mk rpm

This will take a minute or two.

4) Install the newly created RPM

$ cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<your-architecture>/
$ sudo rpm -Uvh kusp<your-version-os-and-arch>.rpm
