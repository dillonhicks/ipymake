#Name ideas for ipymake

= Whats in a name? =

IPYMake is a pretty generic name for the application. While this is generally good since it is also descriptive, it is also unimaginative.

Ideas Thus Far:

  * smartmake 
    ** Also uninspired, but provides the naming scheme similar to smartgdb. 
  * pyety (pronounced piety)
    ** Sounds cool, play on words/spelling. Possibly bad if taken out of context since there could be a religious context. I was thinking "devotion to python" but that could also be the name of the package of tools.
  * pybuild
  * pyarch (pronounced park) 
    ** Python Architect, too clever?
  * kenobi
    ** obviously a major nerd reference
  * py-wright
    ** A couple good variations on this one. It could be wright as in frank lloyd wright (famous architect), or sounds like 'playwright'.
