0.1 Final Release Todo
************************

**High Priority**

* Automated installation system for binary files created by ipymake as
  well as a some sort of installation hook to specify additional
  header and data files to be installed as well.

* Create a viable way to recursively pass the command line arguments
  to ipymakefiles in deeper directories.

  * Fix the "--force-recompile" option.
