KUSP UNIT AND REGRESSION TESTS

These tests are meant to give more information about potential
problems before they occur. Since I have been the one in charge of
maintaining some order in the software tree I whole-heartedly believe
that the time has come for a series of simple tests that we can run
after a successful install of our software. In the long run it would
be nice to see these tests also decent unit tests, but for now
regression tests are quite useful as we are still trying to stabilize
our software tree since the CMake conversion.

In the first iteration of these tests, it will primarily focus on
giving feedback about the Python modules. First and foremost an easy
test to accomplish is seeing if the modules installed properly with an
import test. Then after an import tests we can develop some use
testing. Since we already have experiments and other code that use
Python modules, I think this will be trivial as well.

The second iteration will focus on directly testing the library code
using C as a sanity check. The problem here is that the libraries also
use the kernel as well.
