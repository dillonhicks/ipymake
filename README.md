IPymake

This project I made sometime in 2009 our of sheer academic
curiosity. I was fed up with the syntax of Make which, at times, is
extremely frustrating and enamored with Python. So I asked myself,
could I make a rudimentary build tool that had the production language
look and feel of Make but with a sugar sweet syntax of Python?

The answer was yes, but not without some effort.
