# KUSP Group Scheduling Hierarchy Configuration File Documentation

#
#
# The top heading of the group scheduling hierarchy confgig file
# (.gsh) must start with a section heading similar to the following
# <gsh-installation> section.
#

<gsh-installation>
local-root = "name-of-root-group"
attachment-point = "name-of-associated-executable"

#
#  The *local-root* is the name of the root group of the Group
#  Scheduling Hierarchy (GSH). This is analogous to a 'main' function
#  in the C progrogramming lanugage. This is where the GSH starts and
#  the main basis off of which all scheduling decisions are made by the
#  kernel for the application that follows a .gsh configuration file.
#
#  If the main group in your hierarchy is foo then you would specify:
#  
#  *local-root = "foo"*
#
#
#  The *attachment-point* is the string name of the
#  application/executable that you wish to be under Group Scheduling
#  control. If your program's name is fred, then you would specify:
#  
#  *attachment-point = "fred"* 
#
